*An example of Motion Blur using kMotion with the [Boat Attack](https://github.com/Verasl/BoatAttack) demo.*

kMotion provides full object motion blur for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline. It does this by generating a full camera and object motion vector texture, which can then be used for various temporal effects. Motion blur can then be enabled with the provided **Motion Blur** **Volume Component** for Scriptable Render Pipeline's **Volume** system, supported by default in Universal Render Pipeline.
